# SurveyInference
# This Java tool was developed to support network surveys, with three specific elements:
# 1) interaction with Government stakeholders to anonymize explicit fields (columns) of a given data file
# 2) infer network ties between actors and output to DynetML
# 3) clean entries with a thesauraus map
